### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

     Lab 6, part 2 stands out as a favorite because it involved a balance of programming skills and mathematical knowledge. One of the key takeaways was the importance of input validation and how a well-designed program should be robust enough to handle unexpected inputs and provide meaningful feedback to the user. Also, this lab gave me the chance to practice command-line arguments and learn the importance of storing values in a double or float variable for calculating averages with decimal parts.

* Lab 8

     Lab 8, part 2 was particularly engaging because of the unique aspect of using the Trial Division algorithm by Fibonacci and Heronâ€™s method. In addition, the lab showed me that the most straightforward solution may not always be the most efficient one and to look for ways to optimize code. Lastly, the process of implementing the integer square root function allowed me to learn about the concept of iterative approximation and how it can be used to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve precisely.

* Lab 9

     Lab 9, part 2 was a distinct experience because of the implementation of file manipulation and the understanding of file I/O operations. I learned the importance of checking for valid inputs and handling errors, which is essential to any aspect of practical real-world programming. The game program also emphasized the need for error handling in the design to display relevant error messages.
